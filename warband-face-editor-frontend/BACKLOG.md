## In Progress üöß

### Advanced Mesh Morphing
- [ ] Create more sophisticated morph targets for better deformation
- [ ] Implement normal recalculation for smoother morphing
- [ ] Add more vertex regions for finer control

## Planned Features üìã

### 1. Face Code Integration
- [ ] Decode face codes like `00000000000000006c3199cc1bdc235500000000001c11810000000000000000`
- [ ] Map face code values to morph targets
- [ ] Real-time face updates from code changes
- [ ] Generate face codes from current morph values

### 2. Additional Assets
- [ ] Hair models (man_hair_*.obj, woman_hair_*.obj)
- [ ] Beard models (male_beard_*.obj)
- [ ] Proper texture mapping for all variations

### 3. Export/Import
- [ ] Save current face configuration
- [ ] Export face code for game use
- [ ] Import face codes from clipboard

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Better lighting presets
- [ ] Background options
- [ ] Screenshot functionality

## Technical Debt üîß

- [ ] Error handling for missing textures/models
- [ ] Loading states for assets
- [ ] Performance optimization for texture switching
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Known Issues üêõ

- Face morphing sliders currently don't affect the mesh (synthetic morphs not working)
- Need to implement proper Mount & Blade face code parsing
- Some textures might not align perfectly with UV mapping
