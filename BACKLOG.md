# Development Backlog for mb-app

This backlog follows Claude Code best practices for task planning and project improvement.

**IMPORTANT**: This project serves as the foundation for the warband-face-editor (https://github.com/doppelmarker/warband-face-editor), a web-based 3D character face customization tool. Features are prioritized based on their importance for enabling web-based face editing functionality.

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED - December 2024
**Face Code Support Implementation Complete!**

We have successfully implemented full Mount & Blade Warband face code support with:
- âœ… Complete 43-morph face code parsing (exactly matching game format)
- âœ… Perfect round-trip encoding/decoding (verified with game examples)  
- âœ… All appearance parameters (hair, beard, age, skin, hair_color)
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (7 tests, all passing)
- âœ… Ready for web editor integration

**This unlocks the path to the web-based 3D face editor!** The next critical step is creating a FastAPI wrapper to expose these functions as REST endpoints.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Face Code Support
**Priority: CRITICAL - COMPLETED December 2024**
**Goal: Enable parsing and generation of Mount & Blade Warband's 64-character hexadecimal face codes**

### Background:
Mount & Blade Warband uses 64-character face codes (e.g., "0x000000018000004136db79b6db6db6fb...") that encode:
- 43 morph targets (3 bits each, last one 1 bit) for detailed face shape
- Hair index (6 bits)
- Beard index (6 bits) 
- Age (6 bits)
- Skin tone (6 bits)
- Hair color (6 bits)
- Additional appearance parameters

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Face code parsing module** (`parse_face_code_components()`):
  - [x] Parse 64-char hex string to structured data using correct 4-block layout
  - [x] Extract all 43 morph values (morph_keys 0-42)
  - [x] Extract hair, beard, age, skin, hair_color parameters
  - [x] Validate face code format with comprehensive error handling
- [x] **Face code generation** (`generate_face_code()`):
  - [x] Convert structured data to hex code with proper bit packing
  - [x] Handle 4-block structure (64 bits each)
  - [x] Generate valid 64-char codes matching game format
- [x] **Character data integration** (`apply_face_code()`):
  - [x] Map face codes to binary character bytes at correct offsets
  - [x] Support bit-packed age/hair_color in bytes 16-17
  - [x] Write appearance data to profiles.dat format
- [x] **Comprehensive test suite**:
  - [x] Test known face codes from internal_format.txt documentation
  - [x] Perfect round-trip conversion tests (encode â†’ decode â†’ encode)
  - [x] Edge case validation (invalid inputs, missing components)
  - [x] Value clamping tests (bit range enforcement)
  - [x] Documentation example verification (age=6 correctly extracted)

### âœ… Technical Achievements:
- **Accurate bit-packing**: Implements correct 4-block structure from Mount & Blade documentation
- **Perfect compatibility**: Face codes match game's Ctrl+E export format exactly  
- **Robust validation**: Handles both 0x-prefixed and plain hex formats
- **Complete API**: Both parsing and generation with full component access
- **Production ready**: 7 comprehensive tests, all passing

### âœ… Integration Points:
- Face codes displayed in character listings with `--show-face-codes` flag
- Components accessible programmatically for web editor integration
- Ready for FastAPI wrapper to expose as REST endpoints

## Notes for Claude Code

When implementing these changes:
1. Always run tests after changes
2. Update CLAUDE.md with new commands
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Document breaking changes
5. Create atomic commits for each task
6. **Consider web editor integration** - Features should be designed with Python library usage in mind
7. **Prioritize face code support** - This is critical for the warband-face-editor project
8. **Design for async/thread-safety** - Web services need concurrent access
