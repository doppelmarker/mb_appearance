# Development Backlog for mb-app

This backlog follows Claude Code best practices for task planning and project improvement.

**IMPORTANT**: This project serves as the foundation for the warband-face-editor (https://github.com/doppelmarker/warband-face-editor), a web-based 3D character face customization tool. Features are prioritized based on their importance for enabling web-based face editing functionality.

## NEW: Face Code Support
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Goal: Enable parsing and generation of Mount & Blade Warband's 64-character hexadecimal face codes**

### Background:
Mount & Blade Warband uses 64-character face codes (e.g., "0x000000003f9c4a40...") that encode:

## Notes for Claude Code

When implementing these changes:
1. Always run tests after changes
2. Update CLAUDE.md with new commands
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Document breaking changes
5. Create atomic commits for each task
6. **Consider web editor integration** - Features should be designed with Python library usage in mind
7. **Prioritize face code support** - This is critical for the warband-face-editor project
8. **Design for async/thread-safety** - Web services need concurrent access
